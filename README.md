# NC News Frontend

## General Information:

Northcoders News serves as a social news aggregation website where users can rate web content and have discussions in the style of Reddit. The main form of content displayed on my NC News are articles which have been divided into topics. Users have the ability, if they are logged in, to create an article, create a comment, post a comment, up or down vote articles and individual comments. Also, a user can delete their own article or comment which they have added when they are logged in.

The making of NC News had enabled myself to bring together all of the front-end skills (React, CSS, and ReachRouter), technologies and best practices Northcoder tutors had taught. In regard to this, I utilised by backend project by making asynchronous API calls as well as use HTTP request types to interact with my backend, and HTTP response codes to update my UI when needed.

The project was hosted on Netlify and the link can be found here: [https://hb-nc-news.netlify.com/](https://hb-nc-news.netlify.com/)

The repository for my backend can be found here: [https://github.com/Harriet-Blundell/nc-news](https://github.com/Harriet-Blundell/nc-news)

The hosted version on heroku of my backend can be found here: [https://harrietblundell-be-nc-news.herokuapp.com/](https://harrietblundell-be-nc-news.herokuapp.com/)

## Component Tree Plan

The component tree plan enabled me to plan out user stories in a much more clear and concise way. This also helped when designing my wireframe and what I wanted the user to see on the page when they navigated through the website. Most importantly, it significantly benefited when implementing the code to create NC News in terms of what needed to be a class or functional component.
